                        <p>A Chargeback usually happens when a customer files directly with or disputes through his or her credit or debit card issuer a payment on their bill. It may result in the reversal of a transaction.&nbsp; You may be assessed Chargebacks for (i) customer disputes; (ii) unauthorised or improperly authorised transactions; (iii) transactions that do not comply with Card Network Rules or the terms of this Agreement or are allegedly unlawful or suspicious; or (iv) any reversals for any reason by the Card Network, our processor, or the acquiring or issuing banks. Where a Chargeback occurs, you are immediately liable for all claims, expenses, fines and liability we incur arising out of that Chargeback and agree that we may recover these amounts by debiting your Bank Account. Where these amounts are not recoverable through your Bank Account, you agree to pay all such amounts through any other means</p>
                        <h3 class="terms-section__subtitle">Reserves</h3>
                        <p>In our sole discretion, we may place a Reserve on a portion of your Payouts by holding for a certain period such portion where we believe there is a high level of risk associated with your business. If we take such steps, we will provide you with the terms of the Reserve which may include the percentage of your Payouts to be held back, period of time and any other such restrictions that Paystack may deem necessary. Where such terms are changed, we will notify you. You agree that you will remain liable for all obligations related to your transactions even after the release of any Reserve. In addition, we may require you to keep your Bank Account available for any open settlements, Chargebacks and other adjustments.</p>
                        <p>To secure your performance of this Agreement, you grant Paystack a legal claim to the funds held in the Reserve as a lien or security interest for amounts payable by you.</p>
